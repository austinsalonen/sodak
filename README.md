# Suggested Remodel of South Dakota High School Football

The goal here is to make the playoffs hard and championship mean something.  When most schools get in the playoffs, the tournament is diluted and, by and large, pointless.
The first draft will use the rankings given by SDHSAA.

## 9-Man

Currently there are 3 divisions (9AA, 9A, 9B) covering 76 teams, with 48 making the playoffs.  My proposal is for 1 division with 16 teams making the playoffs.
