# Suggested Remodel of South Dakota High School Football

The goal here is to make the playoffs hard and championship mean something.  When most schools get in the playoffs, the tournament is diluted and, by and large, pointless.
The first draft will use the rankings given by SDHSAA.

## 11-Man

There are 4 classes in 11-man football.  40 of 58 teams make the playoffs (69%); in 2016, this included 9 teams with losing records, including 0-9 Sturgis.

Below is my suggested playoff bracket for 2016.  Initially there were two 16-team divisions (I thought there were more 11-man schools) but this allowed too many teams with losing records.  Given this, my suggestion is for one 8-team playoff and a second 16-team playoff.


### Division I
```
( 8): Dell Rapids (43.556, 7-2)
( 1): Winner (47.25, 8-0)

( 5): Madison (45.111, 8-1)
( 4): St. Thomas More (45.667, 9-0)

( 6): SF Roosevelt (44.444, 8-1)
( 3): SF Washington (46.333, 9-0)

( 7): SF Christian (44.111, 8-1)
( 2): Tea Area (47.0, 9-0)

```

#### Division II
```

(16): Red Cloud (40.625, 5-3)
( 1): Mitchell (43.111, 8-1)

( 9): SF O'Gorman (42.0, 6-3)
( 8): Aberdeen Roncalli (42.125, 5-3)

----

(13): Dakota Valley (41.333, 6-3)
( 4): Harrisburg (42.889, 7-2)

(12): West Central (41.444, 5-4)
( 5): Brandon Valley (42.667, 6-3)

----

(14): Sioux Valley (41.0, 5-3)
( 3): Groton Area (43.0, 7-1)

(11): Hot Springs (41.556, 7-2)
( 6): Chamberlain (42.375, 6-2)

---- 

(10): Parkston (41.75, 5-3)
( 7): Bridgewater-Emery/Ethan (42.125, 5-3)

(15): Spearfish (40.778, 5-4)
( 2): Milbank Area (43.0, 6-3)

```

## 9-Man

Currently there are 3 divisions (9AA, 9A, 9B) covering 76 teams, with 48 making the playoffs.  My proposal is for 1 division with 16 teams making the playoffs.

2016 Proposed Bracket

### Flaws

#### Seed points

After looking this bracket, there's some research required to verify the "seed points" metric provided by SDHSAA.  7-2 Dell Rapids _may_ be better than 8-1 Mitchell but more analysis is required.

My initial thought for a tweak would be:

```
{Winning percentage} + {Opponents' winning percentage} + {Points scored ^ 2.4} / {Points scored ^ 2.4 + Points Allowed ^ 2.4}
    (Actual WP)      +       (Strength of Schedule)    +                         (Expected WP)
```
